SpongeFramework
===================

This library is not meant to be used outside of my projects. I'm not your dad and this is public domain so if you want to absolutely use it, go ahead! Please note that this is my personal playground which means that at any moment I could introduce some breaking change, rewrite everything or drop functionnalities.  
The idea behind this is to be able to start a project faster by providing basic stuff such as:
- Default fragments (View, RecyclerView, ScrollView) with subtle animations where you can load data using [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava), handle a general state (data, error, empty) and manage errors
- A collection of Utils classes
- Some widgets

This is what powers [Coderwall-Android](https://github.com/florianmski/Coderwall-Android), [UrbanDictionary-Android](https://github.com/florianmski/UrbanDictionary-Android), [AirportCodes-Android](https://github.com/florianmski/AirportCodes-Android) and [Traktoid](https://github.com/florianmski/Traktoid).
